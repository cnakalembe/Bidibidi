            description: 'Uganda is home to over 1.3 million refugees and asylum seekers due to conflicts in her neighbouring countries especially Southern Sudan and The Democratic Republic of Congo. The unrest in Southern Sudan since late 2013 has led to a large influx of refugees into Northern-western Uganda as a result forested land was cleared in Yumbe district in early 2016Â  to host the refugees and Bidibidi Refugee Settlement was established.
